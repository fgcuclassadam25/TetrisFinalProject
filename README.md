# Classic Tetris in C++ with Qt GUI

This is a C++ implementation of the classic Tetris game using the Qt 6 framework. The project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles including inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. It features a graphical interface, game logic, and real-time interaction using Qt Widgets.

- Shape rotation with wall kick handling
- Line clearing and scoring system
- Increasing game difficulty over time
- Main menu and game over screen using QStackedWidget
- Keyboard controls for shape movement and rotation
- Use of abstract classes and virtual functions
- Shape generation via Factory Pattern
- Matrix rotation logic via custom utility class

## Technologies Used

- C++17
- Qt 6 (Widgets module)
- CMake
- Qt Creator IDE (Recommended)
